# 📄 PDF Invoice Usage Guide

## 🎯 **When to Use PDF Invoices**

The PDF invoice feature generates professional, downloadable invoices for psychology clinic services. Here's when and how to use it:

---

## 📋 **Invoice Creation Flow**

### **1. When Invoices Are Created**

Invoices are typically created **after an appointment is completed**:

```
Appointment Completed
    ↓
Invoice Created (manually or automatically)
    ↓
Invoice Status: "Draft" → "Sent"
    ↓
Patient/Admin Downloads PDF Invoice
    ↓
Payment Processed
    ↓
Invoice Status: "Paid"
```

**Invoice Creation Scenarios:**

- ✅ **After appointment completion** - When a session is marked as "completed"
- ✅ **Manual creation** - Admin/Practice Manager creates invoice via API
- ✅ **Automatic generation** - (Future: Auto-generate on appointment completion)

## 👥 **Who Can Download PDF Invoices**

      },
    }
  );
  
  if (response.ok) {
    // Get PDF blob
    const blob = await response.blob();
    
    // Create download link
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.download = `Invoice_${invoiceId}.pdf`;
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    
    // Cleanup
    document.body.removeChild(link);
